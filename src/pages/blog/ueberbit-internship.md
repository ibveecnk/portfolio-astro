My first ever internship was at [UEBERBIT GmbH](https://ueberbit.de), an agency specialized in digital transformation and web development, in 2018 as part of the [BOGY-Programme](https://km-bw.de/,Lde/Startseite/Schule/Berufs_+und+Studienorientierung+_BOGY_).

The main task during the two-week phase of the internship was to build a dynamic Blog-CMS with abilities to manage users, posts and categories (see [here](https://github.com/ibveecnk/Blog-UE)) written in _Javascript_, _HTML/Handlebars_ and _CSS_ using a technology stack of

- [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) for the frontend and
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as a dynamic database solution.

In that week I had my first contact with the processes for (web-)development in a company-setting (e.g. git, docker, linux administration), while before I only had done some programming in smaller scope without any guidance. It was a great experience getting to know great people and acquiring new skills to build upon.
