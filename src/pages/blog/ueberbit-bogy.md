I first worked for [UEBERBIT](https://ueberbit.de) in 2018 as part of the [BOGY](https://km-bw.de/,Lde/Startseite/Schule/Berufs_+und+Studienorientierung+_BOGY_)-Programme, created to get students to know the world of labor.

The main task for the one-week phase of getting to know a job was building a dynamic Blog-CMS (see [here](https://github.com/ibveecnk/Blog-UE)) using a technology stack of [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) for the frontend and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as a dynamic database solution.
In that week I had my first contact with the processes for (web-)development in a company-setting, while before I only had done some programming in smaller scope without any guidance. It was a great experience, getting to know great people, later leading to multiple holiday internships and a student job.
